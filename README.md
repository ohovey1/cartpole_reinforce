# Policy Gradient for CartPole - Reinforce Algorithm

This project involves implementing a simple reinforcement learning algorithm -- RETINFORCE -- to solve the classic CartPole problem using PyTorch.

The objective is to keep a pole balanced upright on a moving cart. The agent controls the cart by either pushing it left or right, and must learn to maximize the time the pole stays upright.

**Goal:** Agent's task is to keep the pole balanced for as long as possible. If the pole angle exceeds a certain threshold or the cart moves out of bounds, the episode ends.

This project will use PyTorch to build the NN model the represents the policy, which will output a probability disctribution over the actions.
